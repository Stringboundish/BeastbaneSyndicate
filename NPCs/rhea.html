    <summary>Backstory</summary>
    <p>Rhea was born in the ash-stained gutters of a fallen border town, her Tiefling heritage hidden beneath soot and silence. Her mother, a runaway Hellknight squire, vanished the night Rhea’s tail first twitched. Alone, unwanted, she survived by thievery and unnatural instinct—her words could lull guards to sleep, her eyes made grown men hesitate. But the first time she was cornered, she didn’t beg.
She called the blade.
They say it wasn’t forged. It simply answered.
The sword named Whisperscourge—sleek and black like an oil-slick nightmare—manifested from nothing, flickering with cold, curious hatred. That night, five men died, and Rhea didn't flinch once. She was sixteen.
Years later, she was found again—not by hunters or Hellknights, but by the Beastbane Syndicate. Quinn tracked her for days, drawn by rumors of a “ghost girl with a living sword.” He expected a threat. Instead, he found a woman who moved like a ghost and struck like poetry. She smiled at him the first time they crossed blades. He still has the scar.
The guild brought her in for her unique talents—arcane edgework, hexes, and interrogation artistry. She doesn’t fight for coin or glory. She fights for control. Over others. Over the whispers. Over herself.
She’s never revealed where her blade truly came from. Some say it’s her soul. Others say it’s a piece of something far, far worse.</p>
